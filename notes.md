# Contracts
* Why use smart contracts:
  * https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/
* Hold ether 
  * just create the contract with value and it will hold it
* Call API
  * ChainLink
    * Core Adapters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHp7me2Yks 
    Already installed in chainlink software, http get, copy, json parse, etc
    * External Adapters: build own external functinoality, can run off-chain. (Opensource packages for chainlink nodes.)
